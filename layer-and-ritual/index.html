<h2>READINGS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Midwinter Day Part 2 and 3: I like that we are sprung into the life of this parent exploring and navigating life with their children. The perspective allows us to never really clue in completely when we are talking about the other parent or when we are talking about the kids, and i also like how things sometimes devolve into long lists describing a place. it feels similar to the piece we read about exhausting a place, which makes me think about neurodivergence in writing. as the writer gets distracted we get thrown into a deeper hole in the text that all of a sudden we are taken out of and placed back into the context of the author’s world.</li>
  <li>CA Conrad: Rituals for Poetry: this video really made me think. at times it did feel as though Conrad was using the tragedy and traumatic experience of their ex-partners murder as a sort of personal narrative, but i think it also was a personal narrative for them to explore through their writing, as they spoke about. this video also really helped me conceptualize the rituals that i hope to include both in my final project for this class and in my work in general. questions i walked away with were: what are some ways i can incorporate my spiritual rituals into my creative practice, beyond in personal creation? how can my work show rituals? can i make durating pieces that follow this ritualistic pattern?</li>
  <li>The Crisis of Infitinite Worlds: i liked the way this was written but i think this reading and the list prompt that goes with it confused me a bit. i attemped to make a list but i look forward to our class discussion. i did like the way this poem felt like a love letter to a person who it felt like wasn’t here anymore, and it felt very exsistential in that way.</li>

<h3>What are the rituals you engage in to enter/exit the creative space?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>smoking herbs has become a large part of my ritual to creative process. i would even say that in my most ritualistic creative endeavors i try to engage all of the elements to create a sacred space. a lot of this is influenced by the rituals i conduct outside of my creative space, and how the things i learned about rituals in that sense have informed the way i think about my creative process. </li>
  <li>i think i also try to remind myself of the purpose of what i’m creating and keep my mind focused on what i want to explore. sometimes i get a bit carried away with this stage and end up in a google clickhole but most times its helpful.</li>
  <li>i also like to get in tune with my body and engage all of my senses. having a diffuser going, playing music that fits the mood i want to work in, sitting near a window so my vision stays stimulated during breaks and even leaving my phone away from me—essentially i need to create an atmosphere that allows me to really get lost in my work and the environment and not social media. i think since a lot of the work i do is online or on the computer i get easily distracted by social media and text messages so i have to keep my phone far away, i can manage that better when i’m just on my laptop. </li>
  <li>i should really think about going deeper into investing in some exit rituals for my creative practice, because i will literally never stop working. i don’t think i know how to exit the creative space until i feel that i’m either finished with the project or at “A Good Stopping Place,” which usually means i’m only like 1 or 2 steps away from finishing. i think reviews are a big part of my exit ritual, which in a way can be kind of….not demoralizing but stupid of me to do because i just put a bunch of hours in to something that i took one pass at but feel really confident in and then people give me edits and i’m either too impatient and already turned in/sent the designed thing or i get unnecessarily precious with what i just created. if i were to create an exit ritual right now, i think reflecting on what i accomplished during the creation session would be key as well as establishing next steps, but then giving myself time to like walk away from the thing and then come back later. in a perfect world i’m incorporating meditation into both my entry and exit rituals for my creative space. there’s no time like the present tot start!</li>
</ul>


<h3>What rituals are part of your life outside the creative space? </h3>
<ul>
  <li>my investment in my spiritual practice has become a pretty significant ritual in my life. on full/new moons i like to take a cleansing bath where i try to invoke the spirits of my ancestors, namely my two grandmas, and ask them to protect me and also guide me towards doing what’s best for me and my life. i find the bathtub/shower to be a very spiritual place, as well as bodies of water in general. i guess it depends on the water because i’ve seen some nasty shit but i will for sure say that i treat shower and bath time as sacred ritualistic practices. anyways, after the cleanse if nothing else i will light a pillar candle and keep it lit for three days and leave water and crystals under the moonlight to charge up. i also try to journal based on prompts that the specific astrological signs are calling in during their specific planet transits. this all serves as a way for me to connect deeper with myself and how i’m feeling, so regardless of the public’s opinion about astrology i just like being connected to myself while working on connecting to my ancestors. the people i come from were spiritual, our practices robbed from us and called witchcraft, and i believe in the connect between us and What Else Is Out There. if we carry trauma from the generations that existed before us, then surely their spirits are still with us as well.</li>
  <li>outside of spirituality i think there are a lot of rituals that i participate in in my life. i think most of my life is ritualistic practice if you think about it. i have specific schedules for every day of the week that include what i do when i first wake up and my commute to campus some days of the week. i’ve been attempting to add a meditation ritual into this daily cycle of rituals and i won’t say it’s been hard i just could do better at remembering. is there a difference between a routine and a ritual? does ritual imply more spiritualistic meaning that routine, or do they carry the same weight? perhaps routines are the more mundane day to day things like commuting, but a ritual is waking up, staying in bed for 30 minutes then getting up to immediately brush my teeth and wash my face then make coffee and read. but without intention, is that a routine? is a ritual just a routine with intention? </li>
  <li>a funny ritual i partake in also happens when i cook meat of any variety. i always call my dad. he was the one who prepared the best (read: most) meat when i was a kid so i count on him to know how i should do it for myself. obviously thoughts of life and death come to mind during this thought process and i realize that one day this will become a ritual i can no longer partake in, and that makes me sad but also encourages me to take advantage of the ritual now while i still can. what are other expired or expirable rituals that we partake in?</li>
</ul>
