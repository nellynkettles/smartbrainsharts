  radical excess
everywhere i go we turn up and do it big
i got $100 in my bank account and that's enough for the night
dripping in Target gold
been told i spend way too much
for someone with that many student loans
tryna provide for everybody all the time
tryna live like a baller
tryna live while we still have time

abundance personified
the love i felt surround by
(is love just good communication?)

i'm doing it up! flexing like there is no budget!
living like there is no tomorrow!

i hoard all the things i've ever recieved
every birthday card
every thank you
note that has been crumpled by all the other things existing in my space

you could say its familial, to be surrounded by things. this is my life
if my relationships are abundance personified, by things are my life personified
can i fill myself up only on me?

under the [shadow]light of the new moon we ask for abundance
i need my ancestors to let me hold a dollar or two
or fifty
maybe a billion and then i could buy out all the empty hotel rooms n fill em with anyone who has been stranded out in the cold
and pay for safe shelters for the young ones [older than i in ways]
navigating their lives at the helm of the law
gender persecution as it exists in the capital nation shockingly ain't shit compared to the outside
is the grass really green here? surely the american dream is to be choked alive by your own ambitions
excessive ambitions
my own hands grasp my neck trying to determine WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH MY LIFE
