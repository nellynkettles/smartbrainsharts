    tomorrow i will wear something pretty. i am of the age of understanding what my body/mind can do and how it guides me through it.

    am i connecting with others if i'm not posting on social media? is what i post my only way of keeping in touch with my friends? what happened to texting, when did it become so harrowing? has all the distance between us #intheseuncertaintimes made talking harder? why have things been /feeling/ so intense lately? is it because i'm connecting deeper to my body, or have i just started to analyze my body in the same way i analyze my feelings + my mind? why do i feel like i've lost my drive? i miss my family.

  the world is so vast and life is so short, with so many complexities and nuances to be navigated at every moment. they cloud my head often and yet simultaneously i'm able to notice how little it all matters. when we die all that's left is our things: our physical things that become burdens for those we leave behind (but also serve as a means of bringing them together, or a way to keep our memory alive) and the memories people have of us. our lives work, the dreams we spoke, the things we said. we take with us the unsaid, unheard and unfelt. it depresses and scares me to think that all of these words, thoughts, complex feelings and emotions, nuances of the brain could evaporate into the ether unless i vocalize them. what if i only want to vocalize then to myself? will i die and be mis-remembered? will people fight over my legacy? what /were/ my pronouns? did i want to design? was i a journalist? what am i doing? if i were gone tomorrow, who would know me? who wouldn't?
