<mark>NEXT TIME U GET BURGER CITY U OWE 2.75</mark>
it was a very long day. i had just finished my weekly pilgrammage to new brunswick and was coming back to a home alone and man i desperately wanted a burger. it's weird ordering from burger city now because what if fable is the one who answers the phone and asked what you thought of the weed he gave you IN YOUR HAND while he delivered your buger and milkshake last time? or what if he asks why you didn't buy from him? obviously it's fine you just say the homie (the homie being your good friend (and i feel justified calling tajah one of my good friends now)'s cousin) is your go-to and i think he'd understand. ok fine i'll do it because this burger is literally going to be the perfect ending to this day. those fries hit way different. hi can i get a cheeseburger with fries and a chocolate milkshake? delivery? 304 schaefer street. yep that's me! ok sounds good, thank you! bye. nice that's ordered. i didn't pay though. tony's has chip readers for delivery though so should be all good. i forget about this payment debacle until i get a call that my order has arrived. i go downstairs. hi! thank you so much! oh RIGHT DUH i didn't pay yet. let me get my wallet really quick. *runs back upstairs* ONLY CASH?? ok.... i have $10. ARE YOU SURE??? I'M SO SORRY. THANK YOU. *cringe for the rest of my life*

<h3><mark>itchy left boob</mark></h3>
i've never had an itch in my left boob before and of course WebMD had to say that it could be real bad like breast cancer bad. I think I get a little extra scared about boob things knowing that there's just a little lumpy guy chilling in my right one. but my left boob is the one that itches. why? and only sometimes? is it the material of my tank tops? they always make my boob itch. i washed them a bunch though so that doesn't make sense. maybe its just anxiety scaring me into thinking a small itch is something worse. usually i notice and get scared about the itch when i'm high. really should stop drawing medical conclusions when i'm high that helps no one especially not myself <strong>GOD I CANNOT THINK OVER THE SOUND OF MY ROOMMATE RIGHT NOW</strong> anyways back to my boob. currently it actually doens't itch which is just fucking textbook because as soon as i point out a problem or make arrangements to solve a problem it goes away on its own. i'm sure the itch will come back, maybe its linked to my period. writing exercises are easy for me because i'm a rambler and can fill space and time with words as they come into my head. anyways itchy left boob. hopefully it itches by the time i go to my planned parenthood appointment otherwise i'll just look like another hypochrondriac who WebMDs every single small ailment that ever happens to them. SURPRISE! It's because i AM another hypchondriac who WebMDs ever minor inconveinience.

<mark>-turbulence</mark>
it's anxiety inducing yet can also be thrilling. it's like all the fear of that first huge drop on a roller coaster. except there's that subtle fear that you very well could die all of a sudden in this huge flying piece of metal that you find yourself sitting in, uncomfortably close to strangers who either watch tv on their phones or listen to music or try to calm a baby. could also think about turbulence as it applies to life things. there are very few instances where i feel that pit drop feeling like you do on planes and rollercoasters. maybe when i feel scared it happens but in that instance its all bad no inklings of excitement or joy. maybe instead of scared its more of when you are embarassed or feeling exposed. feeling exposed (broad sense) gives me that stomach-drop feeling. it's pretty turbulent too like who tf had the audacity to air my business out like that!! it's usually like when you're being exposed but no one knows its you. THATS THE KEY. I felt inner turbulence in 4th grade when we were going over state tests and my teacher put my test example on the projector to show kids how wrong some of the answers were and she hid the names but i knew it was mine and everyone laughed because i was a stupid little 4th grader who didnt understand math concepts if numbers weren't involved
