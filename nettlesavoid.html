    i wrote all this stuff down about things i avoid as i was thinking of them because i figured the prompt was loose in the same way as the "i remember" piece and i really just wanted to catch all the thoughts that were going on in my head that felt poetic:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>i try to avoid thinking about how michael k williams died at 54 and andre leon talley at 73 and virgil abloh at 40 or chadwick boseman at 36. it gets easier as the days go on. knowing the traumas affecting my ancestry will take all of us to am earlier grave gets harder
  <br>
  <br>
i'm slightly conflict avoidant but love to box
<br>
- why do we need to have arguments face to face? i can more clearly articulate myself in a thoughtfully written text that i have thought about and reflected on. if i confront you in anger i won't be listening. i understand the importance of *feeling* my feelings but what about anger deserves to be felt with others?
<br>
<br>
i avoid a lot of things.<br>
great at avoiding people <br>
strive to avoid police <br>
i've got a nose for avoiding a bad crowd <br>
- that sometimes leaves me lonely tho <br>
- my dad taught me to trust my instincts young <br>
i'll avoid talking about my feelings unless someone else brings it up
i avoid letting myself be dark again <br>
- in retrospect it felt bad for my optics <br>
- feeling my feelings landed me in the psych ward so we work hard to breathe easy <br>
<br>
i wish i could avoid the detriments of systems built on and for oppression. i wish i could avoid the anxiety of the american negro experience. i would love to avoid going into debt for learning to be a smart and useful consumer in the eyes of an in(visible) hand. <br>
<br>

i would've loved to avoid working at fucking weight watchers. really didn't see that one being on my timeline. <br>
<br>

i wanna avoid any feelings of lack or that i'm less than
- bc who is that serving?</strong>

obvioulsy i was trying really hard to be a certain type of poetic there...but i feel like there's two distinct voices in my head. there's the one that kind of just thinks tangentally? tangentically? idk anyways there's the train of thought and then there's the defining voice that comes after the tangents start making sense and it pieces them together in a nice way using words i've most definitely encountered from like a twitter thinkpiece or something. this voice is what i feel like comes from a creative place, like it's able to make sense of all the stupid thoughts in my brain. not stupid, just...fast moving and hardly making sense. it (The Voice) always makes itself distinct from my train of thought because it repeats until i forget or write it down, and luckily i've started keeping a log of a good marjority of these. i actually wrote down two of them in the notes page when i was keeping my "avoid" notes bc ariel said we could write wherever our brain took us and i wanted to just let myself think and then come in and read over everything in code. looking back at it now i can see that the two defining thoughts from The Voice both related to what we call ourselves (there's gotta be a better word for that that i'm not thinking of):
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>maybe we should only call people geniuses after they die.
<br>(that's not fair. we should give people their flowers.)
<br>(true. but) genius is a lofty term to throw around. i mean no one called michael jackson the king of pop when he was alive.
<br>(is that true?)
<br>
<br>
black or indigenous people never call themselves BIPOC. i'll say black when referring to myself. BIPOC if referring to myself and others who aren't black but fit into that category </strong>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
and then this banger came to my mind because obviously i'd love to know what everyone thinks of me at all times:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>i try to avoid thinking about the conversations that happen (about me) when i'm not around</strong>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
but as any stupid (not stupid) person would do i didnt misread the prompt per-se but i wasn't really thinking of things i avoid in my practice. i was just listing all the things in my life that i avoid because i definitely be avoiding a looooooot of things LMAO but i think that still applies to my practice. and the things i avoid there. for instance, i decided to write this entire piece how i would talk. or i attempted to bc that shit is hard. it was like differintiating between The Voice and then *my* voice which is...wild and harder than i think it should be. (i'm gonna add a break. maybe i should just go back through and add breaks)<br>
<br>

all that to say i obviously avoid being formal in my writing because i honestly hate grammar. that shit is...feds! i feel like grammar sucks like who came up with that besides a narc. i'm kidding i was a journalist so i know that would really enrage some people but IM ALSO NOT KIDDING because grammar is definitely racialized and i was bad at english and yeah. fuck that. (this is one of those traits that makes me feel like an aquarius) <br>
<br>

obviously i also like to avoid and reject any notions of whiteness...maybe not whiteness but like capitalism? colonialism? professionalism? whatever it is that like constitues that writing has to be a certain way and that you can't just brain dump on to a page and add some funky line breaks and call that a poem. (that's so "anti." i'm in my anti era no rihanna!) <br>
<br>

ok i'm officially just trying to force myself to think of things i avoid in my design and art practice which means i'm out of words to say and original ideas for now and i've rambled for like at least a whole page so i'm ending this here. you could say that in doing so (and overall honestly) that i'm avoiding sounding like an idiot (definitely am not an idiot but i am for sure someone who could talk less)
