  RADICAL EXCESS
everywhere i go we turn up and do it big
i got $100 in my bank account and that's enough for the night
dripping in Target gold
been told i spend way too much
for someone with that many student loans
tryna provide for everybody all the time
tryna live like a baller
tryna live while we still have time

<span class="stop">EXCESSIVE.</span>
abundance personified
the love i felt surround by
(is love just good communication?)

i'm doing it up! flexing like there is no budget!
living like there is no tomorrow!

i hoard all the things i've ever recieved
every birthday card
every thank you
note that has been crumpled by all the other things existing in my space

you could say its familial, to be surrounded by things. this is my life
if my relationships are abundance personified, by things are my life personified
can i fill myself up only on me?

under the [shadow]light of the new moon we ask for abundance
i need my ancestors to let me hold a dollar or two
or fifty
maybe a billion and then i could buy out all the empty hotel rooms n fill em with anyone who has been stranded out in the cold
and pay for safe shelters for the young ones [older than i in ways]
navigating their lives at the helm of the law
gender persecution as it exists in the capital nation shockingly ain't shit compared to the outside
is the grass really green here? surely the american dream is to be choked alive by your own ambitions
excessive ambitions
my own hands grasp my neck trying to determine what i want and how i am and if i should try to occupy space again

take it up
take it up
take it up
YOU DESERVE IT

do i? critics say i'm a talker

why can't i write a poem without switching into vague matrix-morpheous type rhyme beats? relax kid. write what you feel. there is never any pressure to write so stylistically

although it does feel more fun to design your words
i don't hold them precious but i like the way they look on the page and they way they generate in my brain

i like the way that things loosely make sense and the fact that its because i'm trying way to hard to be a mysterious deep poet who can draw feelings out of you and leave you with something deep

ITS NEVER THAT DEEP. [unless it is. special use case and i'll let you know]

communication is love and my cup s'not yet runneth over but it's sitting under the faucet and someone forgot to shut it all the way off. faucet broke, cup empty

together they find a purpose

an excess of peace
