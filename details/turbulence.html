      it's <mark>anxiety inducing yet can also be thrilling.</mark> it's like all the fear of that first huge drop on a roller coaster. except there's that <mark>subtle fear</mark> that you very well could die all of a sudden in this huge flying piece of metal that you find yourself sitting in, <mark>uncomfortably close to strangers</mark> who either watch tv on their phones or listen to music or try to calm a baby. could also think about turbulence as it applies to life things. there are very few instances where i feel that pit drop feeling like you do on planes and rollercoasters. maybe <mark>when i feel scared it happens</mark> but in that instance its all bad no <mark>inklings of excitement or joy</mark>. maybe instead of scared its more of when you are embarassed or feeling exposed. feeling exposed (broad sense) gives me that stomach-drop feeling. it's pretty turbulent too like who tf had the audacity to air my business out like that!! it's usually like when you're <mark>being exposed</mark>
     but no one knows its you. THATS THE KEY. I felt <mark>inner turbulence</mark> in 4th grade when we were going over state tests and my teacher put my test example on the projector to show kids how wrong some of the answers were and she hid the names but i knew it was mine and everyone laughed because i was a <mark>stupid little 4th grader</mark> who didnt understand math concepts if numbers weren't involved

<h2> <u>subtle fear</u> </h2>
such an interesting way of viewing fear. sometimes there are things that are only moderately terrifying. or at least the kind of terrifying that feels...blurry. like meeting new people, engaging in new spaces. the subtle fear that everything you just said is being criticized or judged by whoever you're speaking to. the subtle fear that you had something in your teeth all night and no one said anything but they'll talk about it after you leave, maybe even share a laugh in your absence. the subtle fear that <strong>you</strong> could be the problem. honestly i think some of the most subtle fears that i encounter are along the lines of feeling like a fraud, of imposter syndrome running rampant and suddenly taking control of my visions. i think that remains subtle because it allows room for you to deny that fear, or at least to ignore it. i can be in a room and feel completely alone or unworthy or maybe <code>and mostly</code> just shy but only subtly, softly. a background task. the subtle fear that you'll forget your background tasks. existing feels like living through these moments and feelings. maybe i mean the <button>hard</button> part of existing is living through these moments and feelings. in the moment itself these feelings can really feel not-so-subtle. maybe subtlety is just an outward appearance, and observation from outside your brain. <blockquote>
  "wow, i'm doing such a good job of not acknowledging this fear!"
</blockquote>
does that even count as subtle? and then there's out interactions with other people: what does it mean to deem *someone else* subtlely fearful? is that a presence i want to have? is that a presence others want to have? surely i think someone wants to feel a little feared in some regards. i think in a way i <del>like</del> <code>maybe better to say</code> embrace the idea that as a black queer femme-leaner i am feared by white people as a perception. my presentation can make me subtley fearful, or at least i like to embrace and believe that it is. but also in that vein i think i hold a subtle fear for the fact that someone could consider me subtley-fearful and use that as an excuse to exercise violence (physical, mental, state) on me. is my presence fearful? do i want it to be? should i want it to be? i definitely SHOULDN'T have to ask myself these questions often but <code>all together class!</code> unfortunately i do because of the times we live in. <br> <br>maybe my biggest subtle fear of all is that the times we live in will truly never change.

<h2> <u>inklings of excitement or joy</u> </h2>
those moments where the anticipation hasn't surmounted to too high of expectations but still gives you that feeling that something good is happening. something good is going to happen. when it starts to feel like everything is going your way. initially i wrote this detail descrbing an instance where there were <strong>no</strong> inklings of excitement or joy, and thinking of inklings caught my eye. an inkling of hope can be all you need to get by some days. inklings of excitement or joy can be a little harder to come across on a daily basis but they're noticeable experiences when they're there. the feeling when a friend schedules time to come visit, a friend you haven't seen in a long time. getting a paycheck! winning a sports bet. watching <big>ella enchanted</big> or <big>enchanted</big> and letting yourself get swept away in the corny rom-com romance (or in the acting excellence of anne hathaway or amy adams). matching with someone on tinder who thought was really cute (that inkling goes away when they sit at the top of your match list for weeks or months). thinking about drops of excitement or joy like the first drop of a watercolor on a plain canvas. it spreads as far as it thinks it can but it can always go farther, it just needs the support of a couple more ink drops or maybe the addition of a new color to combine and become on new beautifully colored inkling, even if that color is brown or black because when did we decide these colors were ugly or a sign of failure in color mixing? when did i decide this? isn't brown being the ultimate color you achieve after mixing all the colors together powerful? brown, the unified color of the palette? maybe i will change that definition in myself. maybe then it will change within those around me, because our influence is wider than we think and expands in ways we never know. that's a nice little inkling of <select class="" name="">
  <option value="">excitement</option> <option value="">joy</option> <option value="">hope</option>
</select> <fieldset>
  i feel it when i finally feel my mind running in the same direction as my feet, moving in the same direction as my hands.</fieldset>

<h2> <u>being exposed</u> </h2>
<big><strong>overexposure to the sun can lead to a lot of problems later down the line.</strong></big> Did you know you can even be exposed to the sunlight from indoors? Those moments just after you wake up, when you stand and look out at the cats wandering around in the snow in your neighbor's backyard, trying to get them to notice you as you sip your coffee and contemplate the tasks for your day — without the proper amount of sunscreen these moments can become harmful. <mark>Exposure can become harmful at any point.</mark> overexposure or underexposure. Has this become prevalent because it's been detailed in my mind? Or are there constantly moments of exposing happening around us? When you hang out with friends you haven't seen in a while (some of them who live here but move differently than you, others you see a bit more regularly but still only even once in a blue moon), and someone brings up a halloween party you had where you didn't invite the other person (admittedly on purpose because you wanted to avoid anyone else's exposure to what we can now deem The Chad Boyfriend amongst other things)—that's an exposure. When you're with your new friends who you're starting to feel closer to but are unsure of how they feel and you start to get a sense that you're bringing up details from times you guys hung out a little too much, it felt as though you were the one doing the exposing. Maybe perhaps I fear being exposed because I fear the tension of watching someone feel excluded or left out of key information, or alternatively perhaps I fear sitting there knowingly withholding information while someone else (who isn't aware of the knowledge landmind you sit on) begins to speak freely about fun times you've had. It's a nuanced feeling. <big><mark>Shouldn't it be more freeing?</mark></big> What if feeling exposed is one of the many ways life asks us to get comfortable being uncmfortable? I feel as though that's something I can understand, something I can lean into. In a way it feels similar to a concert with an obstructed view: it's not at all what you wanted or intended to happen but somehow the pressure of watching a new artist fiddling their hands on the guitar or rocking back and forth behind a mic, other body parts obsured, no direct eye contact: it's an awkwardness that you learn to lean into. In a way it takes that awkwardness away completely. What are ways to <sup>embrace</sup> exposure. The easy answer is to say, "be truthful." But what if you were never being untruthful? What if there is no such thing as an objective truth? What if the party invite never went out because of a complexity in the friendship (in which microagressions were said and never addressed before we all left the apartment for the last time)? What if something as small as a friend telling you about eating Americone Dream icecream with a warm brownie is life changing enough for you to share with you friends about how it changed your life? <pre>What if perhaps the problem is that I dramatacize all things to the point of exposure?</pre>
