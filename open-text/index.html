    <h1>"Rejection of Closure" assignment</h1>

<h4>i saw things i imagined // i saw <em>things</em> i <em>imagined</em></h4>
<pre> new york <em>is</em> pretty far from our hometowns

words really <em>do</em> try endlessly to describe what we see

                                                                                black people sleeping on the trains
                                                                                            we <em>have</em> had a long day, haven't we?
                                  can't wait to be home


my brother told me once
him and his friends joke around
by saying
<blockquote>
  "i <em>could</em> kill you."
</blockquote>
        he could!
      really is something you could've not said on acid












                                                                                what feminizes me?

                                                                                thank you for validating my existence Black Woman
                                                                                i sense this <em>has</em> been a tough road you laid down



              for me
              the moments when frivolous things start to add up.
              the world feel — — — too heavy



god damn
        it

words really will never be able to encapsulate what we see
because i can't even remember that conversation we had at brunch yesterday


                                                                                the gooey arms of my brain trying to cling to the last visualizations of our conversation — — —



                                                                                 coming up dry


the gap between being present








                                                    knowing in the moment
                                                    this will soon cease
                                                    to exist in your goo








and wanting desperately to have your life written out like the screenplay of a movie
so that you can constantly go back and revisit that ONE THING
THAT MADE YOU LAUGH OR

THE THINGS YOU STARTED TO SAY EN MASSE BUT STILL TO THIS DAY CANT remember





<em>ok can i be real for a sec?</em>

UNDER THE LIGHT OF THIS PISCES-TURNED-ARIES MOON;
the pisces-turned-aries struggles to validate himself
                                              herself
                                              themself with words. they sit

jumbled in my mouth
on the tip of my tongue
lodged in my throat
on your back
at the top of my head
just on the tips of my fingers but never spoken out loud

because the word is never right






well maybe "never" is the wrong word
            well maybe "maybe" is the wrong word

                        well maybe i'm the wrong one saying the word and therefore the meaning changes because you change and when you change you become less clear



                                    didn't they teach you that in school?

WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS?

the point is that we're clearing you out
you cannot stay here any longer — — — new forms hope to exist

                                                                                                                          like the ghosts that like to trickle in behind the door
                                                                                                                          they can either be nice or they can leave



            YOU however have to go.
            on to paper even better
            i'm making space for something
                                              audacious









                                        <strong>and this is a reckoning</strong>

<h3>closed text: "Twenty Nine" from Tao Te Ching by Lao Tsu</h3>
<details>
  <pre><em>Do you think you can conquer the universe and improve it?
  I do not believe this can be done.

  The universe is sacred.
  You cannot improve it.
  If you try to change it, you will ruin it.
  If you try to hold on to it, you will lose it.

  So sometimes things are ahead and sometimes they are behind;
  Sometimes breathing is hard, sometimes it comes easily;
  Sometimes there is strength, and sometimes weakness;
  Sometimes one is up and sometimes down.

  Therefore the wise avoid extremes, excesses, and complacency.</em></pre>
</details>

I chose this as my closed text because (and the title suggests as well) the Tao is valued as a way of attriubuting meaning to life in a similar way and value as the Bible. This text follows poetic stanza format, but comes to definitive answers and "objective truths" about the ways in which we should live in the world.

I chose this as an example of an open text because in a way it is an exhaustion of a thing, but at the same time represents an inconclusive and almost never ending list. It allows the reader to think of the people in their lives who they view as their president, while also allows the reader to wonder who else the author isn't mentioning. The form of this text also takes on a rather open approach to poetry and language. It feels like we are with the author during this reckoning and refusal of what is all of our reality.

<h3>Selection from "The Rejection of Closure"</h3>
<pre><em>Because we have language we find ourselves in a special and peculiar relationship to the
objects, events, and situations which constitute what we imagine of the world. Language
generates its own characteristics in the human psychological and spiritual conditions. Indeed,
it nearly <strong>is</strong> our psychological condition. </em></pre>

<h4>what are the political implications of an "open" and "closed" text?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>open text is not authoritative</li>
  <li>open text "resists commodification and reduction"</li>
  <li>closed text is conclusive, or at least aims to be</li>
  <li>open text is disruptive</li>
</ul>

<h4>why reject closure as opposed to accepting both "open" and "closed" texts as Hejinian asks on page 3</h4>

<ul>
  <li>because open text leave room for the reader to participate and revisit. the clsoed text attempts to solve everything almost, even things that can never be solved (like the descriptions of the world around us)</li>
</ul>

<h4>what are some devices Hejinian suggests serve to "open" a poetic text?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>repition</li>
  <li>free form, but also formality as an activity</li>
  <li>feminist writing</li>
</ul>

<h4>notable quotes and pages</h4>
<ul>
  <li>"The writer experiences a conflict between a desire to satisfy a demand for boundedness, for containment and coherence, and a simultaneous desire for free, unhampered access to the world prompting a correspondingly open response to it...The impulse to boundedness demands circumscription and that in turn requires that a distinction be made between inside and outside, between the relevant and the (for the particular writing at hand) confusing and irrelevant—the meaningless." p.3-4</li>
  <br>
  <li>"Indeed, the conjunction of <em>form</em> with radical <em>openness</em> may be what can offer a version of the "paradise" for which writing often yearns—a flowering focus on a distinct infinity." p.4 </li>
  <br>
  <li>"For a moment, for the writer, the poem <em>is</em> a mind." p.6</li>
  <br>
  <li>"Can form make the primary chaos (the raw material, the unorganized impulse and information, the uncertainty, incompleteness, vastness) articulate without depriving it of its capacious vitality, it's generative power? Can form go even further than that and actually generate that potency, opening uncertainty to curiosity, incompleteness to speculation, and turning vastness into plentitude? In my opinion, the answer is yes; that is, in fact, the function of form in art. Form is not a fixture but an activity." p. 8</li>
  <br>
  <li>"...a blur of displacement, a type of parallax, exists in the relation between things (events, ideas, objects) and the words for them—a displacement producing a gap." p. 9</li>
  <br>
  <li>"...and by what often seems to be the inadequacy of the imagination that longs to know it—and, furthermore, for the poet, the even greater inadequacy of the language that appears to describe, discuss, or disclose it." p. 10</li>
  <br>
  <li>"Language itself is never in a state of rest" p. 11</li>
  <br>
  <li>"The "rage to know" is one expression of the restlessness engendered by language. "As long as man keeps hearing words / He's sure that there's a meaning somewhere," as Mephistopheles points out in Goethe's<em>Faust.</em>" p. 13 </li>
  <br>
  <li>"The project for these French feminist writers has been to direct their attention to "language and the unconcious, not as seperate entities, but language as a passageway, and the only one, to the unconcious, to that which has been repressed and which would, if allowed to rise, disrupt the established symbolic order, what Jacques Lacan has dubbed the Law of the Father. <br><br> If the established symbolic order is the "Law of the Father," and it is discovered to be not only repressive but false, distorted by the <em>illogicality</em> of bias, then the new symbolic order is to be a "woman's language," corresponding to a woman's desire." p. 14</li>
  <br>
  <li>"'A feminine textual body is recognied by the fact that it is always endless, without ending,' says Hélène Cixous:'There's no closure, it doesn't stop.''" p. 15</li>
  <br>
  <li>"...we long to join words to the world—to close the gap between ourselves and things—and we suffer from doubt and anxiety because of our inability to do so. <br><br>Yet the incapacity of language to match the world permits us to distinguish our ideas and ourselves from the world and things in it from each other. The undifferentiated is one mass, the differentiated is multiple. The (unimaginable) complete text, the text that contains everything, would in fact be a closed text. It would be insufferable." p. 16</li>
  <br>
  <li>"While failing in the attempt to match the world, we discover structure, distinction, the integrity and seperateness of things." p. 16</li>
</ul>
