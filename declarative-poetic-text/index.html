    <p><span class="start">TOMORROW</span> i will wear something pretty. i am of the age of understanding what my body/mind can do and how it guides me through it.</p>
<br>
    <p class="itals">am i connecting with others if i'm not posting on social media?</p>
    <p class="itals">is what i post my only way of keeping in touch with my friends?</p>
    <p class="itals">what happened to texting, when did it become so harrowing?</p>
    <p class="itals">has all the distance between us <span class="hashtag">#intheseuncertaintimes</span> made talking harder?</p>
    <p class="itals">why have things been <span class="bolditals">/feeling/</span> so intense lately? is it because i'm connecting deeper to my body, or have i just started to analyze my body in the same way i analyze my feelings + my mind?</p>
    <p class="repeat">why do i feel like i've lost my drive?</p>
    <p class="bolditals">why don't we ever ask the tree if it made a noise when it fell
    all alone?</p>
<br>
  <p>i miss my family. the world is so vast and life is so short</p>
  <p>so many complexities and nuances to be navigated at every moment. and yet</p>
  <p>i notice how little it all matters. when we die all that's left is our <span class="bolditals">/things/</span>:</p>
<br>
  <p>our tangible things become burdens for those we leave behind</p>
  <p>(as a means of bringing them together to keep our memory alive</p>
  <p>my grandma made skirts out of neckties and how wonderful is that and yet</p>
  <p>so hurtful that she couldn't recieve these flowers</p>
  <p>i lay for her)</p>
  <p>and the memories people have of us live in finite time, until all are forgotten.</p>
  <p>our lives work, the dreams we spoke, the things we said.</p>
<br>
  <p>we take with us the unsaid, unheard and unfelt. it depresses and scares me to think that</p>
  <p>all of these words, thoughts, complex feelings and emotions, nuances of the brain could evaporate into the ether</p>
  <p>unless i vocalize them. <span class="itals">what if i only want to vocalize them to myself? will i die</p></span>
  <p class="itals">and be mis-remembered? will people fight over my legacy?</p>
  <p class="itals">what /were/ my pronouns? did i want to design? was i a journalist? what am i doing? if i were gone tomorrow,</p>
  <p class="itals">who would know me? who wouldn't?</p>
<br>
  <p>i dont like to be alone with other peoples thoughts.</p>
  <p>maybe i'm so self-concerned that i think everyone is talking about me.</p>
  <p>maybe i'm just mistrustful.</p>
  <p>maybe i'm having an insecurity exposed.</p>
  <p>i'm definitely hungover and feeling vulnerable. i'm feeling really depressed though.</p>
  <p class="repeat">why do i feel like i've lost my drive?</p>
