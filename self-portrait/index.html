    <h2>a self portrait exploration by kellyn nettles</h2>
    <br>
<p>i am inputting values into a web system believed to know The Me Who I (Probably) Wish I Was</p>
<p>am i just trying to avoid the all knowing, ever-intrusive-only-forward powers of The Internet?</p>
<br>
<p>bring in the water bearer, i am ready to turn the tides.</p>
<br>
<p>the Target brand acrylic on Target brand canvas,</p>
<p>a small moth trapped in the corner of the wooden frame custom made by zach</p>
<p>(in 2017, when i was mad at him upon receiving and Handled It Pretty Poorly)—</p>
<p>true in practice but not intention; it is time to begin again</p>
<br>
<p>unsure of what i "encompass," or if disassurance is where i want to remain, i perform</p>
<p>holding steadfast to the possibility of existing outside of choice.</p>
<p>sacrifice</p>
<p>sacrifice made right at the start of the path</p>
<p>is it true? we dunked into the cosmic slop at the millennium.</p>
<p>i am blinded in my quests for more/new knowledge</p>
<p>a part of me learned, basking in the ooze</p>
<p>toggling</p>
<p>switching</p>
<p>clicking</p>
<p>sliding</p>
<p>typing</p>
<p>liking</p>
<p>sharing</p>
<p>thinking</p>
<p>|</p>

<p>|</p>
<p class="highlight">thinking|</p>
<p>no more thinking, "we" know</p>
<p>and "we" can take it from here</p>
<br>
<p>"we" are going to be here for a while</p>
<p>but "we" are still looking at the same thing</p>
<p>yeah that's okay "i'm" the only way to get the money</p>
<p>back in the front of your house</p>
<p>so sorry we missed your meeting yesterday</p>
<br>
<p>there is no confusion, no comparison, no questions to answer.</p>
<p>i am here—learning, breathing,</p>
<p>worrying, hoping,</p>
<p>trembling. fighting. i have to. i *get* to.</p>
<p>my tools are Smart—i have them to thank</p>
<p>but my gratitude ends here</p>
<p>i owe them nothing, i feed them not lies but certainly not truths</p>
<p>they'll never make my soul</p>
